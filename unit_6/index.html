					<p>Hello, I'm Eve. These pictures are all created from start to finish every day. The purpose of this project is to carve out moments of self-expression and spark the artist within.<br></br>It's easy to procrastinate, or lose track of time. By documenting these artworks online it helps me to be more creative and persevere at something I love. This is my first year of 'everydays', and I will be focusing on drawing with the Procreate app. I will be experimenting with different brushes, compositions, subjects, and learning the basic techniques.<br></br>

					<p>About me...</p>
					<p>Brought up surrounded by the quiet countryside in Yorkshire, England, I remember drawing on the kitchen walls at age five. I blamed it on my bro who was fifteen at the time. I think scribbling my own name was a bit of a giveaway. Since then I’ve mastered putting pen to paper, and after studying at the University of Michigan and Loughborough University (U.K) I graduated with a BA in Graphic Communications.</p>

					<p>I am fortunate enough for my passion to have become my career. Offering a balance between digital design and traditional drawing skills, my talents extend beyond a computer combining creative, technical, and analytical qualities. Telling old stories and listening to new ones is something I love to do, and I believe storytelling is at the forefront of communication. You can usually find me with my husband and friends, (or hiking, swimming, kickboxing, running, and painting). I also love to eat Nutella from the jar and create logos in my spare time.</p>
